    Group Project Information

    The course evaluation depends for a large part on a group project that needs to be submitted in groups of 4 students. During the group project, you will engage in a real data science project in which you are free to explore your own topics of interests using a dataset provided by the teaching team. 
    Dataset

    This year's dataset will be related to the celebration of 600 years KU Leuven. In that context, the university will launch a 'Citizen Science' project in 2024, in which it aims to involve citizens very closely in scientific research over a three-year period. The chosen project 'From bystander to hero', which is a collaboration between the teaching team of this course and the faculty of Medicine, aims to increase the chances of survival for someone in sudden cardiac arrest by setting up an effective system where citizens are called in to start CPR while waiting for specialised medical help. 

    One aspect of this project is to analyse the current location of AED (Automated external defibrillator) devices with respect to the locations of emergency services and the occurrences of cardiac arrests in Belgium. 
    Information

    The dataset of this year consists of three parts: (1) medical transport data, (2) AED locations, and (3) interventions data. The medical transport data contains detailed information regarding emergency response vehicles and transport logistics. The AED device data contains location and other information related to the presence of AED devices. Finally, the medical interventions data contains a comprehensive overview of medical interventions that took place in Belgium.
    Medical Transport

1. The medical transport data consists of three different data sets pertaining medical transport: (1) ambulance data, (2) PIT data, and (3) MUG data. An ambulance is a vehicle response team consisting of two paramedics (who are not allowed to administer medication), a PIT team consists of one paramedic, and one nurse who is allowed to administer medication, a MUG team consists of a nurse and an emergency doctor often accompanied by an ambulance. The MUG unit is dispatched in the most severe cases.

    The medical transport data contains the following columns:
        Hospital ID
        MUG ID
        Campus ID
        Name Hospital
        Name Campus
        Postal Cide
        Municipality
        Region: mapping V=Flanders, W=Walloon, B=Brussels, Vlaams Gewest=Flanders, Waals Gewest=Walloon, Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest=Brussels
        Province
        Unit: uncleaned information on the unit
        Ambucode/ambusitecode: internal IDs used for linking with (external) data source
        Link: additional information on the unit (e.g., links to other hospitals)
        Base: information on the location where the unit is stored
        Medical_resource: identifier of the unit
        Departure location: address
        Departure location number: unique identifier
        Latitiude/longitude: coordinates of departure location
        occasional permanence: indicates whether the unit is permanently available (/staffed) or only occasionally

2. AED locations

The following features are available in the data:

    ID: identifier
    type: Certain characteristiques of the device. Appraeil fixe = Vast apparaat = Fixed device, Appareil Mobile = Mobiel Apparaat = Mobile device, M5066A = specific device you should Google
    address, number, postal_code, municipaility, province = address
    location = more detailed information on the specific location of the aed device at the address
    Public: whether or not it is a public device
    Available: contains information on when the device is available -> use translation services (languages are Dutch and French)
    Hours: similar to available

3. Interventions data

The interventions data consists of 5 large datasets that contain detailed information on the interventions. the following features are present:

    Service name: the name of the unit that responded to the call
    ___ permanence: information on the location of where the permance (the unit that responded to the call) was stationed
    Vector Type: an indication of the type of vector (PIT/MUG/Ambulance) that was dispatched
    Eventtype firstcall: the type of event as determined by the operator the moment the call came in. This provides an indication of the underlying condition of the patient
    Eventtype trip: the type of event as determined at the moment that the trip starts (T2)
    Eventlevel _: a classification on the severity of event types
    ___ intervention: information on the location of where the intervention takes place, i.e., the location where the patient is 
    T...: see below
    Time variables: calculated metrics (by the system) on certain key metrics of the system
    __ destination hospital: information on the location of the destination hospital where the patient is transported to
    Calculated __: additional calculated fields
    Number of transported persons
    Abandon reason: reason why the patient was not transported to a destination hospital (use translation services)

An interesting topic for exploration would involve a comprehensive analysis of the current distribution of medical units, particularly Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs), within the city of Leuven. By leveraging the dataset provided, we can delve into optimizing the placement of AEDs by considering factors such as their proximity to emergency services, historical occurrences of cardiac arrests, and population density. Through sophisticated analytics, we aim to propose strategic recommendations for enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of AED deployment across Leuven.

Expanding beyond the confines of the given dataset, another compelling avenue for analysis pertains to public awareness regarding cardiac emergencies and its potential impact on the effectiveness of existing interventions. By incorporating data sources (outside of those provided), such as public health records, social media sentiment analysis, and surveys, we intend to gauge the level of awareness among the populace regarding CPR techniques, AED locations, and emergency response procedures. Furthermore, we aim to investigate whether heightened awareness correlates with improved response times and outcomes for cardiac arrest victims. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we seek to shed light on the crucial role of public education campaigns in bolstering community resilience and saving lives during medical emergencies.


TOOLS
For our project, we have outlined a robust toolkit comprising various tools and packages to facilitate our analytics and deployment process. To begin with, we plan to utilize the standard analytics and data processing tools available in the rich Python ecosystem, starting with Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing, allowing us to efficiently handle and clean the datasets provided, ensuring they are suitable for analysis. Additionally, we'll utilize scikit-learn, a powerful machine learning library in Python, for tasks such as predictive modeling and clustering, enabling us to extract valuable insights from the data. NetworkX will play a pivotal role in our analytics pipeline, providing essential functionalities for network analysis and visualization, particularly relevant for optimizing the placement of AEDs and understanding the connectivity of medical units. In case our models require additional capacity or complexity, we have provisions to transition to deep learning frameworks such as Torch and its associated graph libraries like DGL and PyTorch Geometric, especially if we are dealing with large-scale datasets that demand more sophisticated modeling techniques. Given the heavy focus on graph-related tasks in our project, we plan to utilize Gensim for topic modeling and possibly Neo4j for graph database management, facilitating efficient storage and querying of complex relational data. Regarding deployment, while we have yet to finalize the platform provider between AWS and Azure, we are prepared to adapt our deployment strategy accordingly. We'll employ the appropriate command-line interfaces (CLI) or Python packages, such as Boto3, to interact with the chosen cloud provider's services, ensuring seamless deployment and management of our application. Containerization will be achieved using Docker engine, allowing us to encapsulate our application and its dependencies for portability and scalability. Finally, for the backend of our deployed application, we are considering Flask due to its lightweight nature and flexibility. Alternatively, if our application requirements align with a simpler interface, we may opt for Streamlit to develop and deploy interactive data-driven web applications efficiently.It's important to note that while these tools and research proposals provide a solid framework for our project at this stage, they are subject to refinement and adjustment as our understanding evolves throughout the course.
